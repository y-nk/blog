It's playful but soooo bugged. It's kinda killing the joy.<p>1/ There's no getter for position and rotation of the marker in the 3D space. Hopefully some dude made a snippet for that. Still it's a shame it comes from "a random guy on the internet:<pre><code>private var transformation:FLARTransMatResult = new FLARTransMatResult();

public function get position():Array
{
  try
  {
    detector.getTransformMatrix(transformation);

    var tmp:Matrix3D = new Matrix3D();
      tmp.n11 =  transformation.m01; tmp.n12 =  transformation.m00; tmp.n13 =  transformation.m02; tmp.n14 =  transformation.m03;
      tmp.n21 = -transformation.m11; tmp.n22 = -transformation.m10; tmp.n23 = -transformation.m12; tmp.n24 = -transformation.m13;
      tmp.n31 =  transformation.m21; tmp.n32 =  transformation.m20; tmp.n33 =  transformation.m22; tmp.n34 =  transformation.m23;

      return [new Number3D(tmp.n14, tmp.n24, tmp.n34), Matrix3D.matrix2euler(tmp)]
  }
  catch(e:Error) {}

  return null;
}</code></pre><p>2/ Axis are not normalized along with Papervision. Z is mixed with Y, and so X is reversed. It's unmanageable when in comes to using the 3d engine (moveForward is moveBackward, pitch, roll, etc...)<p>3/ The only documentation is in Japanese. God I wish I could speak.<p>This makes every authoring task in the 3d environment painful, and I'm not talking about linking with a 3d physics engine which could also bring its own challenges.<p>Even though, it's still very CPU costly. My iMac "latest" needs full power to process a 320x260@30fps camera frame to have some kind of performances.</article></section><footer><a href=./ class=!>← back</a></footer><script>const colors=["blue","cornflowerblue","darkorange","darkturquoise","deepskyblue","dodgerblue","gold","goldenrod","indigo","lightcoral","lightgreen","lightpink","lightseagreen","lightskyblue","lightslategray","limegreen","mediumaquamarine","mediumblue","mediumspringgreen","midnightblue","moccasin","navajowhite","orange","orangered","palegreen","paleturquoise","pink","rebeccapurple","royalblue","salmon","sandybrown","seagreen","skyblue","springgreen","steelblue","teal","tomato"];document.body.style.setProperty("--accent",colors[Math.floor(Math.random()*colors.length)])</script>
