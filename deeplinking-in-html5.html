Plus being a real challenge to learn while rewriting such a famous library, it’s a good opportunity to add the html5 <code>window.history.pushState</code> feature and get clean non hashed urls.<p>The current <a href=http://www.asual.com/swfaddress/ >SWFAddress</a> version listens to <code>onhashchange</code> events and operates fully on <code>window.location.hash</code>. For older browsers, there's a fallback strategy with a timer which checks at low intervals the current browser values against some cached values. If different, the url has changed and a function is called. That’s it.<p>Recently was introduced the HTML History API, with its <code>pushState</code> methods which has the ability to rewrite the current url without having to use a hash. So, prettier urls and better indexation.<p>Using <code>pushState</code> changes the way we check for current url. We must now use <code>window.location.href</code> which holds an absolute url value, rather than <code>window.location.hash</code> which stores a relative value. You somehow need to strip out the <em>base url</em> off the values to operate seemlessly between the two methods.<p>Solving that is easy. There are plenty of solutions but the one I liked the most is to add an HTML <code>&lt;base></code> tag in your document's <code>&lt;head></code>, which describes the base url of your site.<p>As for now a big amount of (dummy) users are still using older browsers, so i also implemented the regular hash engine with events and timers, and choose what method to use with <code>window.history.pushState != undefined</code> test. I really thought that compatibility wouldn’t be a problem but since internet explorer doesn’t store hash values in its history I had to come with a hack implying an iframe, thanks to <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/1647331/335243>stackoverflow</a>.<p>So, it’s working both ways: with and without hash :)<p>I first wrote it as a jQuery plugin because it was easier for me. Even if I mainly do flash websites, I still load jQuery for handy bootstraping features. A while after, i adapted the script to have a pure javascript object. It’s less automatic but there’s no dependencies :)<p>In short, it can be embedded in <code>jQuery.deeplinking</code> or used without dependencies as a global <code>Deeplinking</code> javascript object.<p>The plugin is also able to hook on the top of swfobject directly (both jQuery and standalone). It will try to fire a single function called ‘deeplinking’ with the event type as first argument. Because jQuery’s swfobject plugin had a different behavior — including the object element in the selector instead of replacing it — i had to fork it and do some magic there :/ Bare with me friends.<p>The good news is that, you can even use it with flash content &lt;3<p>Btw, if you’re using that jQuery plugin for a flash projet, you may be interested in fixing an <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/a/2837120/335243>annoying resizing bug</a> generated by jQuery itself.<h3 id=documentation>Documentation</h3><p>You can access the static deeplinking object by using <code>deeplinking</code> for the standalone version, and <code>$.deeplinking</code> for the jQuery version. After that it's all the same.<p>Functions worth mentioning:<p><strong>deeplinking.onready</strong>: Set a function and it will be called when the deeplinking object is ready and running.<p><strong>deeplinking.oninternalchange</strong>: Set a function and it'll be called when there's an <em>internal</em> url update (basically, when you set the deeplinking value by the code).<p><strong>deeplinking.onexternalchange</strong>: Set a function and it'll be called when there's an <em>external</em> url update. It’s the most useful: it’ll be fired when the user changes the url, or press back/forward buttons.<p><strong>deeplinking.value()</strong>: It’s a getter/setter function (depending if there's an argument or not). It will either return the current url, or set the url with the provided value and fire the <code>oninternalchange</code> callback.<p><strong>deeplinking.initialize()</strong>: You need to call this method, hopefully on dom ready. When used with flash, I found that I was easier to let Flash call this method with an <code>ExternalInterface.call()</code>. With jQuery, it’s automatically fired on domready, so chill out.<p><strong>deeplinking.activate()</strong>: Enables the url watcher<p><strong>deeplinking.deactivate()</strong>: Disables the url watcher<p><strong>deeplinking.log</strong>: a log function, for debugging purpose. logging is deactivated by default, but you can turn it on with <code>debug</code><p><strong>deeplinking.debug</strong>: flip this boolean to true to activate logging<p><strong>deeplinking.html5</strong>: flip this boolean to force the use of <code>pushState</code>, but also force the use of hash (if false)<h4 id=compatibility>Compatibility</h4><p>It's been manually tested on:<p>Mozilla Firefox 6 and 7, Chrome 14, Internet Explorer 6/7/8 and Safari 4 for Windows for the PC part, and Mozilla Firefox 7, Chrome 14, Safari 4 for the MacOS part.<p><a href=https://github.com/y-nk/bond>Fourchette it on github :)</a></article></section><footer><a href=./ class=!>← back</a></footer><script>const colors=["blue","cornflowerblue","darkorange","darkturquoise","deepskyblue","dodgerblue","gold","goldenrod","indigo","lightcoral","lightgreen","lightpink","lightseagreen","lightskyblue","lightslategray","limegreen","mediumaquamarine","mediumblue","mediumspringgreen","midnightblue","moccasin","navajowhite","orange","orangered","palegreen","paleturquoise","pink","rebeccapurple","royalblue","salmon","sandybrown","seagreen","skyblue","springgreen","steelblue","teal","tomato"];document.body.style.setProperty("--accent",colors[Math.floor(Math.random()*colors.length)])</script>
