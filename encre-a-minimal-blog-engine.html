You'd need php, a proper DB for comments and article versions... Even though it was working great, at least until you'd need plugins not to get hacked. Migrations were painful, and theming – while being extremely versatile – is still so complex that it could be a path of career.<p>JAM stacks rised up, slowly and solutions such as <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/ >Jekyll</a>, <a href=https://gohugo.io/ >Hugo</a> and <a href=https://www.gatsbyjs.org/ >Gatsby</a> came by. Today, there's so many offers that we even need <a href=https://www.staticgen.com/ >a website to reference them all</a>.<hr><p>When talking with friends about old articles, it kinda pushed me once more in the quest to revive my blog. There were 2 choices:<ol><li><p>Spend some days trying suitables JAM solutions and decide which one to go with hoping it would be customizable enough yet simple enough not to get me discouraged<li><p>Craft a quick and dirty "bare metal" prototype and improve it as seen needed, until I wouldn't need any other feature</ol><p><strong>I had an index page running in a dev server and built into a static page within 2 hours. That's as much as I needed to get convinced to push further.</strong><h3 id=encre>Encre</h3><p>What the name? Well, it's french for <em>ink</em> and that's the proper way to pronounce my handle, so there's that. Also it's <a href=https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/506010907021828096>always such a hassle to name things</a>.<p>Encre is a ridiculously small blog engine. It'll inject markdown files into html templates. Nothing more, nothing less.<p>It hasn't been made to compete with giants like gatsby but rather only to fit my needs about how to build a simple blog and sometimes hack into it.<h3 id=setup>Setup</h3><p>The installation process is quite simple since I've been shamelessly use npm for myself, publishing this tool as a package.<pre><code>npm install encre</code></pre><p>You'll have to create a minimal filesystem structure. You can do so by typing:<pre><code>mkdir {static,posts}</code></pre><p>You'll also need a main template. Run <code>touch static/index.html</code> and later add:<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>&lt;/title>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;div id="main">&lt;/div>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre><ul><li><p>The <code>posts</code> directory is where you'll put your <code>.md</code> files.<li><p>Your <code>index.html</code> will serve as default layout and must contain a <code>#main</code> node where the dynamic part will be injected.<li><p><em>Optionally</em>, you can have a separate <code>/static/post.html</code> template file for single posts.</ul><p><strong>That's for the setup.</strong><h3 id=development-server-and-build>Development server and build</h3><p>The package exposes two commands which you can use in your <code>package.json</code>.<ul><li>the <strong>draft</strong> command will spawn a simple express server on port 9999 for you to write locally<li>the <strong>write</strong> command builds your files into <code>dist/</code></ul><p>You can invoke them directly using <code>npx</code> with <code>npx draft</code> and <code>npx write</code> or you can put them in your npm scripts to link with other steps:<pre><code>{
  "name": "blog",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "draft",
    "build": "write"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "encre": "1.0.6"
  }
}</code></pre><p><strong>...and that's for the build.</strong><h3 id=authoring>Authoring</h3><p>There's nothing very special to know about it. Markdown files will be parsed using <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked>marked</a>, with metadata extracted from <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/gray-matter>gray-matter</a>.<p>Those metadatas only exist to be given to your custom templating functions. There's no mandatory fields or whatsoever.<p>The url of the markdown will be the <code>${filename}.html</code>.<p>As an example, you can create <code>posts/my-first-post.md</code> and write down:<pre><code>---
title: My first post!
---
yay \o/</code></pre><h3 id=templating>Templating</h3><p>The two commands <code>draft</code> and <code>write</code> can take exactly one argument, which is the path to a js file made for customization.<p>Let's call it <code>renderers.js</code><p>You can modify your npm scripts accordingly:<pre><code>{
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "draft renderers.js",
    "build": "write renderers.js",
  }
}</code></pre><p>Once this is done, your <code>renderers.js</code> file can export few functions to customize the output of your pages.<h4 id=-headdocument-jsdom-metadata-object-void>• head(document: JSDOM, metadata: object): void</h4><p>If you create an expose this function, it will be used as a hook to modify the <code>&lt;head></code> tag of a page. The function receives the full document as a JSDOM object and the metadata collected from gray-matter.<p>As an inspiration, the default function for this renderer is:<pre><code>const head = (document, data = {}) => {
  const { title = '' } = data
  document.title = title
}</code></pre><h4 id=-indexdocument-jsom-posts-post-string>• index(document: JSOM, posts: Post[]): string</h4><p>This renderer is dedicated to the list of posts which is in your index file. The document is passed along in case you need to create tags.<p>The post object contains <code>{ data: string, meta: object }</code>, data being the content of your markdown and meta being the metadata from gray-matter.<p>A simple example of customization would be:<pre><code>const index = (_, posts) => (`&lt;ul>
  ${ posts.map(({ meta }) => (`&lt;li>
    &lt;a href="${meta.link}">${meta.title}&lt;/a>
  &lt;/li>`)) }
&lt;/ul>`)</code></pre><h4 id=-titlemetadata-object-string>• title(metadata: object): string</h4><p>This last customization option allows you to generate the title block of a page from its metadata. It will be injected before the content of the markdown.<p>You could use:<pre><code>const title = ({ title }) => `&lt;h2>${ title }&lt;/h2>`</code></pre><h4 id=putting-it-all-together>Putting it all together</h4><p>In <code>renderers.js</code>:<pre><code>const head = (document, data = {}) => {
  const { title = '' } = data
  document.title = title
}

const index = (_, posts) => (`&lt;ul>
  ${ posts.map(({ meta }) => (`&lt;li>
    &lt;a href="${meta.link}">${meta.title}&lt;/a>
  &lt;/li>`)) }
&lt;/ul>`)

const title = ({ title }) => `&lt;h2>${ title }&lt;/h2>`

module.exports = { head, index, title }</code></pre><p><strong>And voila :)</strong><p>Since the index and title function expects you to take data in input and output a string, you can easily decide to <a href=https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/react-dom-server.html>use React and render to string</a> your components (although it feels really overkill).<h3 id=build-optimization>Build optimization</h3><p>The build will output the files in <code>dist/</code>, leaving them for you to minify, bundle or whatever it is you need to do. I personally minify the html with <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-minifier-terser>html-minifier-terser</a> and css files with <a href=https://cssnano.co/ >cssnano</a> before publishing to github pages with <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages>gh-pages</a><p>For a complete example, you can check <a href=https://github.com/y-nk/blog/ >the repo which hosts this page on github</a>.
