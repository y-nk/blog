So if you're willing to take full advantage of the library, I think it's useful to know what’s going on with this one.<h3 id=quick-look>Quick look</h3><p>As crazy as it sounds, this <em>sequencing</em> package deals with time (and that'd explain its name, <em>t1me</em>). Its primary focus is to handle and regulate how different kind of tasks live during a period of time.<p>I've been thinking how to represent that in the most minimal way, and here's what I came with:<p><strong>A task which can operate through time needs to have a start function, and dispatch a "stop" event.</strong><p>You'd think it's pretty basic, but all what I'm about to tell you about sits on that one principle.<p>So, I've created an interface to represent that. Sadly, interfaces don't include a list of events to be dispatched, so it's not ideal but still.<pre><code>// a class implementing this interface is expected to dispatch a stop event when the task is complete
interface Stackable {
  public function start(): void;
}</code></pre><p>I've implemented a bunch of objects using that principle, such as:<p>• <strong>Load</strong>: which is a unique wrapper around most of the loaders of the Flash APi: Loader, URLLoader, Sound • <strong>Message</strong>: is a simple AMFphp call • <strong>Call</strong>: is a single function call with custom arguments. It looks useless at first but trust me it comes handy. • <strong>Delay</strong>: is basically a unique timer, only to time things out. • <strong>Shell</strong>: is a wrapper for any existing object to become Stackable without having to extends or create something special.<p>Some of these objects also implement 2 other interfaces (which came later, on top of the Stackable one):<p>• <strong>Progressive</strong>: adds a <code>progress: Number</code> (0.0 → 1.0) getter. • <strong>Pausable</strong>: introduces pause/resume functions (which i'm sure you know what are for).<p>Both are implemented in some of those objects already.<p>There's also some <em>misc</em> classes:<p>• <strong>Preloader</strong> holds an abstract logic to handle preloaders with Stackable objects. • <strong>Time</strong> is only made of static constants.<p><strong>The big reveal comes now.</strong><h3 id=sequencing-stackables>Sequencing Stackables</h3><p>If you want to execute tasks in a specific timeline, I've created some <em>managers</em> for that.<p>There are 3 types of managers, which cover all the cases:<p>• A <strong>Sequence()</strong> is an object which runs tasks one by one until the last. • A <strong>Group()</strong> starts all its tasks at the same time, and all tasks run in parallel. • A <strong>Queue(conccurents: int)</strong> is a mix of sequence and group. It executes N tasks of a given stack in parallel and when one of them finishes, picks an other task of the remainings and thus until the end.<p>As an implementation detail, a <code>Sequence</code> is a <code>Queue(1)</code> meaning the parallel tasks can only be 1 at a time ; a Group is a <code>Queue(stack.length)</code> meaning that the size of the parallel tasks is "all the tasks".<p>And to break your mind even more, those 3 are also implementing <code>Stackable</code>, <code>Progressive</code> <strong>and</strong> <code>Pausable</code>. So you can make a Sequence of Groups containing Queues of image loaders - ever need you <em>it</em>.<h3 id=examples>Examples</h3><p>• use of <code>Load</code>, wrapper accessibility (events, content access):<pre><code>var image:Load = new Load('img.png', Load.IMAGE);
image.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, oncomplete);
image.load();

function oncomplete(e:Event):void {
  var bm:Bitmap = e.target.data as Bitmap;
}

// ---

var xml:Load = new Load('config.xml', Load.TEXT);
xml.addEventListener(Event.COMPLETE, oncomplete2);
xml.load();

function oncomplete2(e:Event):void {
  var data:XML = new XML(e.target.data);
}</code></pre><p>Let’s try to embed Load into our managers:<p>• Using a sequence to preloads assets of a website:<pre><code>var config:Load = new Load('config.xml', Load.TEXT);
var locale:Load = new Load('fr_FR.xml', Load.TEXT);
var brands:Load = new Load('brands.png', Load.IMAGE);
var themes:Load = new Load('themes.swf', Load.RSL);

var data:Message = new Message('News.getAll');
var pics:Library = new Library('lib.xml');

var sequence:Sequence = new Sequence();
sequence.addEventListener(Time.STOP, oncomplete);
sequence.stack.push(config, locale, brands, themes, new Call(setup_ui), assets);
sequence.start();

function setup_ui():void {
  /*do something directly with the RSL*/
}

function oncomplete(e:Event):void {
  /* display your data */
}</code></pre><p>• Using a Group to synchronize tasks of custom objects:<pre><code>var shell1:Shell = new Shell(myCustomObject1, "startFunction", "endingEvent");
var shell2:Shell = new Shell(myCustomObject2, "anotherStartFunction", "diffEndingEvent");

var group:Group = new Group();
group.addEventListener(Time.STOP, oncomplete);
group.stack.push(shell1, shell2);
group.start();

function oncomplete(e:Event):void {
  /* continue process */
}</code></pre><p>• Using a Queue to parallelize some heavy downloads while small are sequenced:<pre><code>var bigEmbedVideo:Load = new Load('video.swf', Load.SWF);

var queue:Queue = new Queue(2);
queue.addEventListener(Time.STOP, oncomplete);
queue.stack.push(bigEmbedVideo);

for (var i:int = 0; i &lt; 50; i++) {
  queue.stack.push(new Load(i + '.jpg', Load.IMAGE));
}

queue.start();

function oncomplete(e:Event):void {
  /* loading done */
}</code></pre><p>I think those examples are covering most of the main topics of the package !<p>As usual, comments are welcome :)<p><a href=https://github.com/y-nk/io/tree/master/src/martian/t1me>Sources for this package can be found here</a></article></section><footer><a href=./ class=!>← back</a></footer><script>const colors=["blue","cornflowerblue","darkorange","darkturquoise","deepskyblue","dodgerblue","gold","goldenrod","indigo","lightcoral","lightgreen","lightpink","lightseagreen","lightskyblue","lightslategray","limegreen","mediumaquamarine","mediumblue","mediumspringgreen","midnightblue","moccasin","navajowhite","orange","orangered","palegreen","paleturquoise","pink","rebeccapurple","royalblue","salmon","sandybrown","seagreen","skyblue","springgreen","steelblue","teal","tomato"];document.body.style.setProperty("--accent",colors[Math.floor(Math.random()*colors.length)])</script>
